 * PineTS Transpiler
 *
 * What is PineTS ?
 * -----------------
 * PineTS is an open-source intermediate language designed to bridge the gap between Pine Script and JavaScript.
 * It provides a way to simulate Pine Script-like behavior in a JavaScript environment by representing Pine Script code
 * in a JavaScript-compatible format.
 *
 * Important Notes:
 * -----------------
 * 1. **Independence from Pine Script**: PineTS is not officially affiliated with, endorsed by, or associated with TradingView or Pine Script.
 *    It is an independent open-source initiative created to enable developers to replicate Pine Script indicators in JavaScript environments.
 * 2. **Purpose**: PineTS uses JavaScript syntax and semantics but should not be confused with standard JavaScript code.
 *    It acts as a representation of Pine Script logic that requires transpilation to be executed in JavaScript.
 * 3. **Open Source**: This project is developed and maintained as an open-source initiative. It is intended to serve as a tool for
 *    developers to bridge Pine Script concepts into JavaScript applications.
 *
 * What Does PineTS Transpiler Do?
 * --------------------------------
 * PineTS cannot be executed directly in a JavaScript environment. It requires transpilation into standard JavaScript to handle
 * Pine Script's unique time-series data processing. The PineTS Transpiler facilitates this process by transforming PineTS code
 * into executable JavaScript at runtime, making it possible to execute Pine Script-inspired logic in JavaScript applications.
 *
 * Key Features of the Transpiler:
 * --------------------------------
 * 1. **Context Management**: Transforms code to use a context object (`$`) for variable storage, ensuring all variables are
 *    accessed through this context to prevent scope conflicts.
 * 2. **Variable Scoping**: Renames variables based on their scope and declaration type (`const`, `let`, `var`) to avoid naming issues.
 * 3. **Function Handling**: Converts arrow functions while maintaining parameters and logic. Parameters are registered in the context
 *    to prevent accidental renaming.
 * 4. **Loop and Conditional Handling**: Adjusts loops and conditionals to ensure proper scoping and handling of variables.
 *
 * Usage:
 * -------
 * - The `transpile` function takes a JavaScript function or code string, applies transformations, and returns the transformed
 *   code or function.
 * - The transformed code uses a context object (`$`) to manage variable storage and access.
 *
 * Disclaimer:
 * -----------
 * PineTS is independently developed and is not endorsed by or affiliated with TradingView, the creators of Pine Script. All
 * trademarks and registered trademarks mentioned belong to their respective owners.
